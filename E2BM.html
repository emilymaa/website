            <h1>PROJECT</h1>
            <p>E2BM is a two-sided platform that allows businesses to rent small spaces in existing stores to sell their products. This allows small businesses to book spaces for flexible amounts of time to increase their physical presence without incurring fixed rental payments and existing businesses can reduce their rent expense.</p>
            <h1>MY CONTRIBUTION</h1>
            <p>I conducted user interviews, create wireframes, designed all visual assets and the final prototype.</p>

            <p>During the pandemic, small businesses have been impacted drastically. With all the new restrictions and lockdown in place, small business owners have been having to pay an excessive amount of rent for their commercial space, even though it's not being used.</p><br>
            <p>At the same time, the pandemic has sparked many thriving new e-commerce businesses. According to the Census Bureau, 4.4 million new businesses have been created in the US since last march.</p>

            <p>I wanted to create the most simple onboarding experience to provide each business tailored results based on their needs. This processes main goal is to collect essential inputs such as the business’s target demographic, location, and industry to ensure users can find exactly what they’re looking for.</p><BR>

            <p>The browsing process begins with filters provided during the onboarding process. This ensures that the user isn’t scrolling through irrelevant listings. There are futher filters to refine the searches to find the best matches for both parties. </p><BR>
            <P>Each in-depth listing post provides the essential information and has a strong focus on messaging the listing owner to gain further clarification about the space. </P>

            <p>The listing process starts with a filter to divide the type of listing, then funnels to a more detailed view with crucial information about the space.  </p><BR>
            <p>To edit previous listings or to view all current listings, a user can access this through the my profile tab.   </p><BR>

            <p>In my previous iterations, I did not include an onboarding process causing the the filter process to be time consuming and complicated. As a result, users are not able to find their desired results due to the vast number of options. </p><BR>

        <div class="right-text">
            <p>Throughout this week we conducted multiple data collections. The biggest challenge while conducting surveys was finding authentic responses with diverse backgrounds. We were not able to travel to local businesses and ask in-person. Rather, we were required to leverage our existing network. Luckily, our group had multiple connections to business owners in the London area and our hometowns. This actually proved to be a benefit of the virtual setting, we were not limited geographically. </p>
